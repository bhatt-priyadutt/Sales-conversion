# [**Project: Cluster Analysis for Ad Conversions Data**](https://github.com/bhatt-priyadutt/Titanic-Machine-learning-from-disaster)

* The dataset contains information about the company's ad campaigns and I have analyzed the best campaigns among them.
* In this Project, I have performed Exploratory Data analysis, Feature Scaling and used clustering technique to answer the below business questions:
  1. How to optimize the social ad campaigns for the highest conversion rate possible. (Attain best Reach to Conversion ratios/Click to Conversion ratios)
  2. Finding the perfect target demographics with the appropriate clickthrough rates
  3. Understanding the ideal turnaround/decision making time per age group to convert and retarget future social campaigns
  4. Comparing the individual campaign performance so the best creative/campaign can be run again with adjusted audiences.
* Models used: Kmeans
